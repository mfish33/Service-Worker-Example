# Service-Worker-Example

To start the example:
* npm i 
* npm start

There are two main features of this example:
* The ability to cache 'apps' from a zip file and then proxy requests to the unpacked files
* Cross thread function calling (see dev tools)

Code for the service worker and index.ts is in serviceWorker/src
